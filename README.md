We created a Category DataFrame, Subcategory DataFrame, and then Campaign DataFrame.

We used Option 1 Using the Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the contacts excel data into the Contacts DataFrame.

We used quickdbd.com to create ERD and create schema https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chrwT-qe_M8
Using the ERD diagram, we created a database scemas as a Postgres file in pgAdmin and imported all four data files to create the Crowdfunding Database.

We used github to upload all of our files.

Thanks to Hunter, Randy & Sam for the instruction and guidance.
